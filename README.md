# 🏎️ Predictive Car Setup Optimization Project

An intelligent system that recommends optimal Formula 1 car setup parameters for specific tracks and race conditions, using machine learning and optimization algorithms.

---

## 🚀 Project Goal

To minimize lap time or maximize tire longevity by suggesting the best car setup based on circuit characteristics, weather, and other environmental variables.

---

## 🔧 Key Features

- 🧠 **ML-Based Prediction Engine**  
  Predict lap time from car setup parameters using regression models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost).

- 🧪 **Synthetic or Game-Based Data**  
  Data generated from physics models or extracted from F1 simulation games.

- 🧮 **Optimization Algorithms**  
  Use Genetic Algorithms or Bayesian Optimization to find the best setup.

- 📊 **Interactive Dashboard**  
  Built with **Streamlit** and **Plotly** for visualizing performance impact and setup suggestions.
