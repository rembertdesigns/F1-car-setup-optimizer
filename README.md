# üèéÔ∏è F1 Car Setup Optimizer

A comprehensive Formula 1 car setup optimization platform that combines machine learning, physics simulation, and advanced optimization algorithms to find optimal car configurations for different tracks and racing conditions.

## üéØ Project Focus
This project serves as a complete Formula 1 engineering workbench that addresses the complex challenge of car setup optimization through multiple AI-driven approaches.

### Core Problem
Formula 1 car setup involves balancing numerous conflicting parameters (aerodynamics, suspension, braking) to achieve optimal lap times while considering:
- **Track-specific characteristics** (Monaco vs Monza require completely different approaches)
- **Multi-objective tradeoffs** (lap time vs tire wear vs stability)
- **Dynamic conditions** (weather, fuel load, track temperature)
- **Strategic considerations** (qualifying vs race setup, grid position impact)

### Technical Approach
The platform implements three distinct optimization strategies:
- **Bayesian Optimization** ‚Äì Efficient single-objective optimization using Gaussian processes
- **Multi-Objective Optimization (NSGA-II)** ‚Äì Pareto frontier analysis for competing objectives
- **Reinforcement Learning** ‚Äì PPO agent that learns optimal setups through environmental interaction
