## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10 or newer.
* `pip` for package installation.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/rembertdesigns/F1-car-setup-optimizer.git](https://github.com/rembertdesigns/F1-car-setup-optimizer.git)
    cd F1-car-setup-optimizer
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Train the Prediction Model:** The optimizer requires a trained lap time model. If `models/lap_time_predictor.pkl` is not present, you must first train it by running `train_model.py`. This script may require a dataset, which can be generated by a separate data simulation script if needed.

2.  **Launch the Streamlit App:**
    From the project's root directory, run the following command:
    ```bash
    streamlit run src/app.py
    ```
    Open the URL provided in your terminal (usually `http://localhost:8501`) in your web browser.

## 🛣️ Future Enhancements

* **Full Race Stint Simulation:** Integrate the logic from the Pit Stop Simulator to run a multi-lap stint with a given setup, showing how lap times degrade as tires wear out over time.
* **Setup Sensitivity Analysis:** After finding an optimal setup, allow users to analyze how sensitive the lap time is to small changes in a single parameter, visualizing the performance "cliff."
* **Advanced Physics Model:** Replace the formula-based telemetry/lap time functions with a more detailed physics model that accounts for weight transfer, suspension geometry, and more nuanced aerodynamics.
* **User Accounts & Saved Setups:** Implement a simple database backend to allow users to save, name, and manage a library of their favorite setups across sessions.
